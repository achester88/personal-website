## Background

It all stared about 3 weeks ago when I first hear about hackclub's arcade program (if you haven't already check it out [here](https://hackclub.com/arcade/))
and discovered the langjam hackathon<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>. I played around with idea of joining for a while and ultimately decided to, despite the fact that the jam
had already been going on for 3 week by that point.

## Something Something, GO RUST

NIL was design from the jump to be a hard to write, esoteric **compiled** programming language, so using the experience gained writing my
first programing language [lang](https://github.com/achester88/lang), I followed jauhien's iron-kaleidoscope guide<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> (which
proved to be a terrible, terrible mistake). I got started on the lexer changing it to fit my need of parsing line in reverses, only using parsing the
code sourounded by `/* */` characters, etc.

## LLVM

## V1.0
