## Background

It all stared about 3 weeks ago when I first heard about hackclub's arcade program (if you haven't already check it out [here](https://hackclub.com/arcade/))
and discovered the langjam hackathon<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>. I played around with the idea of joining for a while and ultimately decided to, despite the fact that the jam
had already been going on for 3 weeks by that point.

NIL was designed from the jump to be a hard to write, esoteric **compiled** programming language, so using the experience gained writing my
first programing language [lang](https://github.com/achester88/lang), I followed jauhien's iron-kaleidoscope guide<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> (which
proved to be a terrible, terrible mistake).

## Build NIL

### Lexer
I Started off with the lexer following the guide, but tweaking the code to fit my need of parsing line in reverses, only using parsing the
code surrounded by `/* */` characters, etc, etc. Its mainly just loops through the input by line in reverse and then uses regex on detect language
items, classify them accordingly before finally wrapping then up with the source code position in a Rust Struct. The tokens were then collected and passed
as a Vec to the Parser.

### Parser
The Parser. Oh, the Parser, this is where it all started. Still dutifully following the iron kaleidoscope guide, I got started on the Parser while my
first language used a pure single function recursive parser iron kaleidoscope used a recursive descent parser. Already in a somewhat unfamiliar territory,
made the choice to remove the REPL part of iron kaleidoscope, meaning **all** of the parser code need to be modified to remove NotComplete logic.

Similar to the Lexer, the Parser loops though a Vec of grammar tokens determining the token type and passing the list on tokens to the proper function
to be processed. This allows the functions it passes to then operate with certain assumptions based on the designed syntax.

For example:
```python
;{output} (5 + 5)
```

This code would first hit the main function loop before being passed to the parse_expression function to be wrapped as an anonymous function (done for
the sake of simply while working with LLVM), then to the parse_expr function and so on and so on. The result of this little dance then makes its way
all the way back to the main function to be added to the AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) and passed to the IR builder. While this method does lead to a
large codebase, it makes changing, expanding and modifying the language much, much easier down the road.

### F*CK LLVM
Step 3 in the iron kaleidoscope is where my plans for a complied language all fell apart. It was supposed to be simple, install iron-llvm tehn write some
code to convert the AST to LLVM IR.
