## Background

It all stared about 3 weeks ago when I first heard about hackclub's arcade program (if you haven't already check it out [here](https://hackclub.com/arcade/))
and discovered the langjam hackathon<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>. I played around with the idea of joining for a while and ultimately decided to, despite the fact that the jam
had already been going on for 3 weeks by that point.

NIL was designed from the jump to be a hard to write, esoteric **compiled** programming language, so using the experience gained writing my
first programing language [lang](https://github.com/achester88/lang), I followed jauhien's iron-kaleidoscope guide<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> (which
proved to be a terrible, terrible mistake).

## Build NIL

### Lexer
I Started off with the lexer following the guide, but tweaking the code to fit my need of parsing line in reverses, only using parsing the
code surrounded by `/* */` characters, etc, etc. Its mainly just loops through the input by line in reverse and then uses regex on detect language
items, classify them accordingly before finally wrapping then up with the source code position in a Rust Struct. The tokens were then collected and passed
as a Vec to the Parser.

### Parser
The Parser. Oh, the Parser, this is where it all started. Still dutifully following the iron kaleidoscope guide, I got started on the Parser while my
first language used a pure single function recursive parser iron kaleidoscope used a recursive descent parser. Already in a somewhat unfamiliar territory,
made the choice to remove the REPL part of iron kaleidoscope, meaning **all** of the parser code need to be modified to remove NotComplete logic.

Similar to the Lexer, the Parser loops though a Vec of grammar tokens determining the token type and passing the list on tokens to the proper function
to be processed. This allows the functions it passes to then operate with certain assumptions based on the designed syntax.

For example:
```python
;{output} (5 + 5)
```

This code would first hit the main function loop before being passed to the parse_expression function to be wrapped as an anonymous function (done for
the sake of simply while working with LLVM), then to the parse_expr function and so on and so on. The result of this little dance then makes its way
all the way back to the main function to be added to the AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) and passed to the IR builder. While this method does lead to a
large codebase, it makes changing, expanding and modifying the language much, much easier down the road.

### F*CK LLVM
Step 3 in the iron kaleidoscope is where my plans for a complied language all fell apart. It was supposed to be simple, install iron-llvm then write
some code to convert the AST to LLVM IR. So I added the iron-llvm dependency, naively expecting a simple and straight forward process. After trying to
compile the project (and thus iron-llvm) with cargo, I was hit with a simple error that would go on to haunt my dreams.

"***Couldn't execute llvm-config. Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)***"

*Ok. Not that bad I though, one simple error. Shouldn't take more than 5 min to fix*

So I took the obvious next step and googled llvm-config, and after some digging discovered that *duh* I need to install llvm. So one dnf install later
I tried building again, only to once again be hit with:

"***Couldn't execute llvm-config. Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)***"

Ok time for some more digging, and about 15min later I learned that the Fedora llvm package did not include the development features and as such, I would need to
build LLVM from source. As it was already late at the time, I decided to follow LLVM guide to building from source with ninja and let it build overnight
to (hopeful) wake up to a working iron-llvm version to get back to work. Of course, in the typical development, I work half-complete LLVM built and a
full disk. It seemed like I had underestimated both the size of the LLVM build and my 40GB Linux Partition. Simple, I though, I'll just clean some room
and build the min size release.

Look, I'll save you (and me) the trouble of reliving that cycle, but after many (many) installation attempts and a whole lot of file deleting, I was able
to get a working version of LLVM to build. So with a work development version of LLVM, I once again tried to build nil, and once again:

"***Couldn't execute llvm-config. Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)***"

*Great, just Great.*

It was at this point I took a closer look at the iron kaleidoscope repo and realized that both the guide and the iron-llvm package hadn't been touched
in **8** years (9 at the time of writing). Still, I dug deeper and took a look at iron-llvm's GitHub repo with the hopes of finding an installation guide
or at least some docs. It was then I felt true despair when I found nothing but a link back the useless iron kaleidoscope guide and some llvm documentation.
After even more investigating, I finally found track down the documentation for the llvm-sys crate and was able to finally get passed the llvm-config error
by setting the LLVM_SYS_39_PREFIX env and adding the LLVM bin directory to PATH.

*Finally, After at this point several days, I was going to be able to move on with nil and finally get it running.*

Nope. I was hit with at least 100 errors from LLVM with 0 leads as to how to fix it. So I made the **very** hard decision to throw away all of my work
over the past couple of days on getting iron kaleidoscope to build and swap to an interpreter in order to meet the deadline of the jam.

## Evaluate

Since the iron kaleidoscope guide was for a compiler, I had to build NIL's Evaluate from scratch, which thanks to the powerful Parser proved to be
an easy task
